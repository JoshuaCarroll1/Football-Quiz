## Code Validation


### Python

I have used the recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.


| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run.py | [CI PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoshuaCarroll1/football-quiz/main/run.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/py-validation-run.png) |  |

## Lighthouse Audit


I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heroku | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-mobile.png) | Some minor warnings |
| Heroku | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-desktop.png) | Few warnings |

## Defensive Programming


Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | User Action | Expected Result | Pass/Fail | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run.py | | | | |
| | Enter username | User should enter valid username | Pass | |
| | Click on the Edit button | User will be redirected to the edit profile page | Pass | |
| | Click on the My Orders link | User will be redirected to the My Orders page | Pass | |
| | Brute forcing the URL to get to another user's profile | User should be given an error | Pass | Redirects user back to own profile |
